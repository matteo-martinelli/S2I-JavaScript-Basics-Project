# Welcome to my JS-Basics projects! :)
Hello S2I evaluator, and welcome to my 🌐"Javascript Basics Project" repo👨‍🚀!

This project is based on my personal website (ℹ️ check matteo-martinelli.github.io if you are interested ℹ️). 
It has the same header as the website, is equipped with the same bottom 🧭 navigation bar 🧭, respects the same responsivity rules, and 🔗links directly to the deployed website🔗. 

The only element populating the page is the requested 🔄counter🔄. The front-end part is based on JS, as the incrementing and decrementing functions.
Moreover, the JS code can save and retrive the last incremented/decremented value using 🍪cookies🍪. The cookie lifespan is of about 1 day🗓️.

Enjoy it!🎉🎉
